<p class="mdc-typography--body1">MDC List provides styles which implement Material Design Lists - “A single continuous column of tessellated subdivisions of equal width.” Both single-line and two-line lists are supported (with three-line lists planned). MDC Lists are designed to be accessible and RTL aware.</p>
